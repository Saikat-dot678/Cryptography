### **Examples of Practical Stream Ciphers**

#### **1. RC4**  
- **Overview**:
  - Designed by Ron Rivest in 1987.
  - Takes a variable-length key (often 128 bits) and expands it into a 2048-bit internal state.
  - Stream generation: Iteratively outputs a byte at a time; can produce as large a keystream as needed.
- **Usage**:
  - Was popular in early HTTPS and protocols like WEP.
  - Still present in legacy systems, though deprecated everywhere in modern standards.

- **Weaknesses**:
  - **Bias in the Output**:
    - Early bytes (especially the first, second, and third) are biased.
    - Example: Second byte is zero with probability 2/256 instead of the uniform 1/256.
    - Attackers can exploit these biases if they know some plaintext or structure—dangerous in protocols that leak metadata or have headers.
    - As a workaround (not a real solution): Skip the first 256 output bytes (“RC4-drop[n]”)—but this doesn’t solve other flaws.
  - **Long-Range Bias**:
    - Over huge outputs, bytes like "00" (two consecutive zeros) appear more often (with probability 1/256^3 instead of 1/256^2).
    - This helps attackers statistically distinguish RC4 from a truly random stream, a theoretical and sometimes practical weakness.
  - **Related-Key Attacks in Protocols**:
    - Used in WEP, RC4 is vulnerable if keys are related or reused.
    - Makes attacks on encrypted WiFi trivial.

- **Recommendation**:  
  - Do **not** use RC4 in any new designs.
  - Use state-of-the-art primitives instead.

#### **2. CSS (Content Scrambling System, for DVDs)**
- **Overview**:
  - Used for DVD encryption since the 1990s.
  - Designed for easy, cheap hardware implementation.
  - Based on Linear Feedback Shift Registers (LFSRs): digital circuits that output pseudo-random sequences.
  - **CSS Key is only 40 bits** (due to then-current US export regulations). This is far too small for modern security.

- **Structure**:
  - Uses two LFSRs: one of 17 bits, and one of 25 bits.
  - LFSRs are seeded with (almost all) bits from the 40-bit key; details:
    - First two bytes + leading 1 initialize the 17-bit register.
    - Last three bytes + leading 1 initialize the 25-bit register.
  - Both run for 8 cycles to produce 8 bits (one byte), which are added (mod 256) to produce the keystream byte.
  - This process is repeated per byte of data.

- **How It’s Broken (Attack Method)**:
  - Attack relies on known-plaintext: MPEG video files have predictable header bytes.
  - Attacker XORs known plaintext with corresponding ciphertext to get PRG output.
  - Tries all \(2^{17}\) (131,072) possible initial states of the first LFSR to generate candidate outputs for 20 bytes of stream.
  - For each guess, subtract candidate output from the actual output, and check if what’s left matches a sequence that could be generated by a 25-bit LFSR.
  - This narrows down to the correct initial states for both registers, revealing the entire keystream—and thus, the rest of the encrypted movie.

- **Takeaway**:
  - CSS is **trivially** breakable with little computation and known/ciphertext pairs.
  - Many open-source DVD decryption tools (like DeCSS) implement this attack.

- **Other LFSR-based ciphers:**  
  GSM (A5/1, A5/2), Bluetooth (E0)—all share similar, and similarly weak, properties. **Do not use LFSR stream ciphers for security.**

#### **3. Modern: Salsa20 (eStream Project finalist)**
- **Context**:
  - The eStream Project (ended 2008) reviewed modern stream ciphers for security, performance, and suitability for different platforms.
  - Five “eStream finalists” emerged—*Salsa20* is a primary recommendation.

- **Design Principles**:
  - Uses a secret key (128 or 256 bits) and a 64-bit nonce (never repeats for same key).
  - The key and nonce, plus a counter, are mixed together in a state of 64 bytes.
  - State includes:
    - Four fixed constants (e.g., "expand 16-byte k")
    - The 16-byte key (twice)
    - The 8-byte nonce
    - An 8-byte counter (increments with each 64-byte block)
  - This state goes through a series of fast, invertible *round functions* (the “core salsa20” function), shuffled through the state ten times per block.
  - The final output block is produced by adding the original state (word by word) to the result of the ten rounds—the “add” step helps destroy invertibility and strengthen statistical properties.
  - Output is essentially indistinguishable from random and scales efficiently with demand.

- **Usage**:
  - Each key + nonce pair is unique for every encryption, solving the two-time pad/reuse problem.
  - Nonce allows secure key reuse across encryptions (if nonce never repeats for the same key).
  - Achieves high performance (on benchmark hardware, 643MB/s vs. RC4’s 200–400MB/s).

- **Security Status**:
  - No practical attacks—security close to brute-force (2^128 or higher).
  - Used in many secure systems (e.g., ChaCha20, designed by same author as Salsa20, is standardized in TLS).

- **Implementation Notes**:
  - Salsa20 and variants are fast in both hardware and software, designed to exploit modern processor instructions.
  - Used with a MAC (or as part of AEAD mode) for authenticated encryption in secure messaging protocols (Signal, TLS, SSH, etc.).

### **Summary Table**

| Cipher      | Security           | Biases/Weaknesses      | Use-Case/Status                    | Comments                |
|-------------|--------------------|------------------------|-------------------------------------|-------------------------|
| RC4         | Weak               | Biased output, key reuse issues, statistical attacks | Deprecated, only for legacy use     | Not recommended         |
| CSS         | Broken             | 40-bit key, LFSR weaknesses, trivial attacks | Deprecated, DVD-only (trivially broken) | Never use for security  |
| Salsa20     | Strong             | No practical attacks   | Modern, recommended (eStream)       | Fast, secure, easy nonce management |

### **Key Takeaways**
- Never use RC4, CSS, or LFSR-based stream ciphers in new designs.
- Always use a modern, peer-reviewed cipher like Salsa20 (or ChaCha20), making use of nonces to avoid key/keystream reuse.
- Modern ciphers (Salsa20, Sosemanuk, etc.) are both secure and performant; use them with a proper AEAD construction for integrity as well as confidentiality.
