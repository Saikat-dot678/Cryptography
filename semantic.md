### üîê **The Problem: What Does It Mean for a Stream Cipher to Be Secure?**

When defining the security of encryption, we need to answer:

* What can the **attacker** do?
* What is the **attacker** trying to learn?

For stream ciphers (used with one-time keys), the attacker is assumed to **only see one ciphertext**. We want to define security in this limited context.

---

## üö´ Flawed Security Definitions

### 1. **‚ÄúThe attacker shouldn‚Äôt recover the key‚Äù**

Bad definition: An insecure cipher like `C = M` (plaintext equals ciphertext) wouldn‚Äôt leak the key ‚Äî but it still leaks **everything** else. So clearly, that‚Äôs not secure.

### 2. **‚ÄúThe attacker shouldn‚Äôt recover the full plaintext‚Äù**

Still bad: Imagine a cipher that reveals half the plaintext (e.g., M‚ÇÄ‚ÄñOTP(M‚ÇÅ)). Even though it encrypts M‚ÇÅ securely, revealing M‚ÇÄ openly violates confidentiality.

---

## ‚úÖ What We *Really* Want: **No Information Leakage**

Shannon‚Äôs **Perfect Secrecy** said:

> For any two messages `M‚ÇÄ` and `M‚ÇÅ` of the same length, the ciphertext distributions of `Enc(M‚ÇÄ)` and `Enc(M‚ÇÅ)` should be **identical**.

But perfect secrecy requires:

* Keys as long as the message (impractical).
* Key reuse is forbidden.

So we move to a more practical notion: **Semantic Security**.

## üîç **Semantic Security Definition (One-Time Key)**

We define **semantic security** via an experiment with a **challenger** and an **adversary A**:

### üîÅ **Experiment B (where B ‚àà {0, 1})**

1. Challenger generates a random key.
2. Adversary A submits two equal-length messages: `M‚ÇÄ`, `M‚ÇÅ`.
3. Challenger encrypts `M_B` (either `M‚ÇÄ` or `M‚ÇÅ`) and gives ciphertext `C` to A.
4. A outputs a guess `B‚Ä≤` trying to determine which message was encrypted.

---

## üìà Semantic Security Advantage

Let:

* `W‚ÇÄ = Pr[B‚Ä≤ = 1 | ciphertext of M‚ÇÄ]`
* `W‚ÇÅ = Pr[B‚Ä≤ = 1 | ciphertext of M‚ÇÅ]`

Then:

```
Advantage(A) = |W‚ÇÄ - W‚ÇÅ|
```

**Interpretation**:

* If `Adv ‚âà 0`: A can‚Äôt tell which message was encrypted ‚áí Secure
* If `Adv ‚âà 1`: A can reliably distinguish ‚áí Insecure

A scheme is **semantically secure** if **all efficient adversaries** have **negligible advantage**.

## üß† Implication: Leaking *Any Bit* Breaks Semantic Security

Suppose there's an adversary A that can always guess **one bit** of plaintext from ciphertext (say, the least significant bit). Then we can construct B to:

1. Choose `M‚ÇÄ` ending in `0`, and `M‚ÇÅ` ending in `1`.
2. Use A to extract the LSB of ciphertext ‚Üí that directly reveals B.

So advantage = 1 ‚Üí system is broken.

Hence, **revealing any bit (MSB, parity, XOR of bits)** breaks semantic security.

---

## üîí One-Time Pad is Semantically Secure (and More)

The OTP satisfies **perfect secrecy**, which is stronger than semantic security.

In OTP:

```
C = K ‚äï M
```

Since K is random and used once, the ciphertext distribution is uniform and independent of M.

Therefore, for any M‚ÇÄ and M‚ÇÅ:

```
Dist(C|M‚ÇÄ) == Dist(C|M‚ÇÅ)
```

No adversary (efficient or not) can distinguish ‚Äî so **semantic security is trivially satisfied**.
